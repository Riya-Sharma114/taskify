🚀 Taskify

Taskify is a simple yet attractive React + Bootstrap task management app designed to help users stay organized and productive. With its clean UI and interactive features, it provides a seamless way to manage daily tasks effectively.

🧩 Problem Statement

Many people rely on notes or plain lists to track their daily tasks, which often lack structure and interactivity. There’s a need for a lightweight, responsive, and easy-to-use task manager that makes task handling both efficient and visually engaging.

💡 Inspiration

Add, edit, complete, and delete tasks.
